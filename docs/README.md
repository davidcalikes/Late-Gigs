<h1>Late Gigs</h1>

[Live project:](https://late-gigs.herokuapp.com/)

Late Gigs is an online, 'last-minute' booking service for live music in the North East of Ireland. 

Recently, almost every live music venue and act across
the region has been affected by a sudden gig cancellation due to the ongoing Covid pandemic.

This command line application has been designed to help venues and artists, create gigs as quickly and efficiently as possible by firstly, searching through a database of available acts and venues to find a suitable match. If no match is initially found, Late Gigs will store the users information on a Google Spreadsheet then automatically create a gig for the user if a match is found. 

Users can also remove themselves from either of the Google-Sheet waiting lists if they secure an eleventh hour gig by another means.

Utilising Gmail API, Late Gigs notifies both venues and acts on either of the waiting lists by email automatically when a match is made and a gig is created. They are then automatically removed from the waiting lists and placed on a list of confirmed gigs.
